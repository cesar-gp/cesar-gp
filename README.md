# Hi! I'm César 👋
I'm a sociologist specialized on Social Media and User Experience Design from Mérida, Spain.  
This is my GitHub account for professional projects. Take a look, have fun! 😉

        ➡️ <a href="https://cesar-gp.github.io/">cesar-gp.github.io</a> is my portfolio website, which is hosted as a GitHub repository.<br>
        I decided to host it here because I wanted to make it from scratch. It could be moved in the long term.<br>
        <br>
        🔎 It's a somewhat experimental website which takes heavy inspiration from <a href="https://m3.material.io/">Material Design</a><br>
        and adapts it to my own style. Take a look for yourself :)<br>

        ➡️ <a href="https://cesar-gp.github.io/os-dev">cesar-gp.github.io/os-dev</a> is a blog written from scratch in which I document what I learn about Operating Systems Development (OSDev).<br>
        It's designed to be beginner-friendly (mostly because I <em>am</em> a beginner too 🤠).<br>
        <br>
        ⏳ I know no one will be eagerly waiting for the next chapter. But, in case you do... <em>Please, be patient</em>.<br>
