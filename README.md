# Hi! I'm César 👋
I'm a sociologist specialized on Social Media and User Experience Design from Mérida, Spain.  
This is my GitHub account for professional projects. Take a look, have fun! 😉

        ➡️ <a href="https://cesar-gp.github.io/">cesar-gp.github.io</a> is my portfolio website, which is hosted as a GitHub repository.<br>
        I decided to host it here because I wanted to make it from scratch. It could be moved in the long term.<br>
        <br>
        🔎 It's a somewhat experimental website which takes heavy inspiration from <a href="https://m3.material.io/">Material Design</a><br>
        and adapts it to my own style. Take a look for yourself :)<br>
